# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:** 

The purpose of this analysis will be to answer two distinct questions based on the data that was stored. The first question is determining the number of retiring employees per their work title's. The second question is identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Both these questions aim to position the company in a more suitable way for the older workers who will be retiring when they reach a specific age. 

1. **Results:** Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

   Three relevant tables were created to help address the aforementioned first question regarding the number of retiring workers per their title's. 

- First finding that is relevant to the retirement_titles csv table that was created. We can see that the highest amount of workers that will be retiring will be Senior Engineer's with 29,414 workers and senior staff who have 28,254. The remaining roles for Engineers, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer and Managers make up the remaining workers that will be a part of this predicted "silver tsunami". 
- Second highlight from the Retirement_Titles csv an interesting point based on doing a quick count was that 133,776 workers were all born between the year of 1952 to 1955 which shows the extent of how many workers will potentially be a part of this wave and further incentivizes the reasons to prepare for this ahead of time. 
- From the Unique_Titles csv in comparison to the retirement_titles doesn't offer much insight that could not be identified through that table but it does focus in on the fact that out of all the employees, they fill about 7 unique rolls within the company based on there most recent titles to date. Being able to focus on that information through the table could help at least track whether these employees are likely to stay within those roles towards retirement (Especially if they are senior roles) and gives a solid foundation for what the current landscape is. 
- Last but not least the Mentorship Eligibility csv identifies for the proposed eligibility framework that 1549 current employees will be able to apply for this program if it goes as planned. Again, most of the workers in terms of there titles are 43 Assistant Engineers, 304 Engineers, 401 Senior Engineers, 294 Senior Staff, 430 Regular Staff and 77 Technique Leaders. This insight into getting a count was interesting to see as it follows a similar to the roll findings from the retirement_titles table with Senior Engineers and Senior Staff making up a good chunk but with more Regular Engineers and Regular Staff within these birthdate guidelines. 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- As mentioned in my second highlight above, Hundreds of Thousands of workers will be eligible to retire when the silver tsunami takes it's course. 
- In terms of moving more regular workers to senior roles, there seems to be a solid base especially if the mentorship program takes place but with the massive extent of the current workforce that is within this silver tsunami, more employees should be factored into this mentorship program and external hiring would help fill these roles over time if followed through with consistently.
